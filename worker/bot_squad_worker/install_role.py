"""Install role helper — is this install the mothership for a given project?

The mothership produces releases that other attached servers consume. The
self-exclusion guard exists so the producer never accidentally consumes its
own releases (the consumer-side poller / apply short-circuit when this
returns True). See T-0086.

SSOT: the ``mothership`` flag on the project block in projects.toml.
Belt-and-suspenders: also compare ``prod_url`` against a hardcoded
mothership URL — guards against accidental flag-drop on the real
mothership.
